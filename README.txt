DISCLAIMER: 
This repository has been created to display my portfolio. For the sake of time, I have
used a free HTML5 template, courtesy of HTML5UP.net, to allow me to nicely show off my 
skills a a mechanical engineer and my software capibilities. The following is the README
of the template, which I have chosen to display in order to give credit to the makers of 
this template!

This is Massively, a text-heavy, article-oriented design built around a huge background
image (with a new parallax implementation I'm testing) and scroll effects (powered by
Scrollex). A *slight* departure from all the one-pagers I've been doing lately, but one
that fulfills a few user requests and makes use of some new techniques I've been wanting
to try out. Enjoy it :)
